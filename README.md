# KILLING CARROT TOP

## By **Jay Winebrenner**

##  About

Killing Carrot Top is an old school RPG-inspired game set in a collapsed dystopian world ruled by 80s Character Comedians hellbent on exterminating what little remains of the human race. You are the Comedian Slayer, the worlds last bastion of hope of stopping this vile scourge. It is your singular journey to traverse the nightmarish post-apocalyptic landscape and confront the Lord of Laughter himself, Carrot Top.
